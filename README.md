Hi! This is the README File for my individual prototype game: Ray of Hope.

I decided to go with a horizontal slice approach!

Features:

- Navigating terrain
- Movement controls like Jumping and running left and right
- Path selection (to the top platform)
- Light Pulse animation on Lumi's staff
- The Darkness (limited range of visibility), low amount of global light
- Level selection
- Music and Sound effects!
- Collectables added to the game, that allows users to jump higher, run faster and use magical staff
- Health bar and power up bar added, score system added and damage mechanism added
- Main Menu
- At the last level there will be a smart boss that will follow the player around and drain the players health, and the player has to avoid it
- respawn  mechanics added
